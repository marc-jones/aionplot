ORDER was created as part of a project looking at gene expression changes in *Brassica napus* over development.
This website provides an easy way of browsing and graphing the collected data.
It is hoped that the accessibility and usability of the website will foster translational science between *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Brassica napus*.
To facilitate this goal, the website allows the database of *Brassica napus* genes to be queried by *Arabidopsis thaliana* gene codes.

### Guide

The About tab presents information about how the experiment was carried out, such as which *Brassica napus* varieties were grown, how the samples were collected and how gene expression levels were quantified.

The How To Use tab explains how to use the website to search the database.
This is the place to go if you have questions about the user interface of the website.

The final three tabs (Search, BLAST Search and Table) are the tabs you'll be using to search the database.
Please consult the How To Use tab to learn how to go about using them.

### Contact

Please could you direct all enquiries, bug reports and interesting findings which relate to this dataset to [Marc Jones](mailto:marc.jones@jic.ac.uk).
