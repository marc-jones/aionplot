<h1 id="sec0" align='center'>AionPlot</h1>

<br>

AionPlot is a complete time series visualization server and front end; just point it at your time series data and you'll have a website which allows you to query and plot your data.
It was coded with large scale biological time series in mind, in particular RNA-Seq experiments.
There are a few features which are specific to this function, although any time series data can be plotted regardless of it's origin.
This page is the default landing page for AionPlot, and as such does not contain any specific information about the data presented here.
A custom landing page can be provided to AionPlot to remedy this.

### Guide

The About tab should contain information about the data, such as how it was collected

The How To Use tab explains how to use the website to search the database.
This is the place to go if you have questions about the user interface of the website.

The Search tab allows you to search the database.

The BLAST and Table tabs may not be available, but if the website creator has provided AionPlot with the appropriate data files, the BLAST search function on the BLAST tab will allow you to search for time series data based on DNA sequences, while the Table tab will provide additional information on the records selected on the Search tab.

Please consult the How To Use tab to learn how to go about using them.
