<center><h2>How To Use</h2></center>

In order to search the database, please use the Search tab or the BLAST tab if it is available.
How they are used is explained as follows.

### Search

The Search tab allows users to plot time series data.
To search for records, begin to type the name of the record and select the record from the dropdown list.
You may enter multiple records at once.
To plot the time series data associated to a particular record, click on its name.
<div class="[ form-group ]" style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
<input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" name="default_example" id="default_example" autocomplete="off">
<div class="[ btn-group ]" title="">
    <label for="default_example" class="[ btn btn-default ]">
        <span class="[ glyphicon glyphicon-ok ]"></span>
        <span></span>
    </label>
    <label for="default_example" class="[ btn btn-default active ]">
        Record Name
    </label>
</div>
</div>

### BLAST Search

If sequence data was provided to AionPlot, then the database can be queried using DNA sequences.
To do this, copy and paste your sequence of interest into the text box on the BLAST Search tab.
The information box on that page will indicate the number of records which show homology to your sequence.
To plot the expression of these records, navigate back to the Search tab.
The records which show homology to the sequence you entered in the BLAST Search tab will be displayed as 'BLAST Hits'.

### Table

If table data was provided to AionPlot, then this will be tabulated on the Table tab for the records selected on the Search tab.
